                    <p>Gmail, Outlook, Apple Mail, using these everyday is a major part of the Communications industry
                        and we trust it to do its job well, but how much do we know about how email itself works. To
                        begin with, emails are separated into two distinct parts: the message header and the message
                        body. Firstly, the message header, this contains all the data related to the transit of the
                        email, so here you'd find the From, To & Reply-To email addresses, you'd also find the subject
                        and dates of the send. In addition to these attributes which would be visible to the sender
                        before sending, the header also contains the methods by which the email gets from the origin to
                        the destination as well as any security checks that have been performed on the email while in
                        transit and to authenticate that these are valid for delivery. The body of the email, which is
                        what we'll be primarily concerned with, contains the content that's present when a recipient
                        opens this email, which would generally be in either plain-text or in HTML code which we'll dive
                        into in more detail below.</p>

                    <h2>HTML And Email</h2>
                    <p>
                        When you're working in Communications, and you want to pass along the latest news and updates in
                        your organization, you want to do so in an eyecatching and appealing way, rather than simply
                        sending a large block of text. So what's the solution, why HTML-based email of course, allowing
                        you to put structure to your emails including images, video and your own branding! So what is
                        HTML-based email?

                            <tr>
                                <td style="border:1px solid #000000;"></td>
                                <td style="border:1px solid #000000;"></td>
                            </tr>
                            <tr>
                                <td style="border:1px solid #000000;"></td>

                    </p>
                    <p>What you see above is a very simple table made in HTML and rendered by the browser you're using
                        to view this page and what you'll see below is the code underlying that very same table:
                        <pre>     &lt;table style="height:100px;width:100px;border:1px solid #000000; margin:10px auto; border-collapse:collapse;"&gt;
                            &lt;tr&gt;
                                &lt;td style="border:1px solid #000000;"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
                                &lt;td style="border:1px solid #000000;"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
                            &lt;/tr&gt;
                            &lt;tr&gt;
                                &lt;td style="border:1px solid #000000;"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
                                &lt;td style="border:1px solid #000000;"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
                            &lt;/tr&gt;
                        &lt;/table&gt;</pre>
                        </pre?>
                    </p>
                    <p>When it comes to HTML-based email, the code works exactly the same way and whether you're coding
                        it yourself or using a template made by a designer or one of the various online communications
                        platform, they all work on this same code. While our browsers are built to handle this code
                        without issue, when it comes to emails being rendered, there are some things to be aware of
                        depending on the email clients you use and that's what you'll find covered on our <a
