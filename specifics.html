                                    <p>While Gmail is extremely reliable when it comes to rendering the content of your
                                        emails, there is one major situation which can happen when you're needing to
                                        relay a lot of information to your users. Picture this, your code is finished,
                                        the rest renders are all looking good so you go to send the email as a test, you
                                        check your Gmail Inbox and before you reach the end you're greeted with the
                                        following message</p>

                                <div class="gmail_issues">
                                    <p>While Gmail does have few limitations, it does limit the size of emails received
                                        to ~102kb before it will clip any excess content. This limit is derived from
                                        both the content and the code of these emails so the longer your emails get the
                                        more likely they are to be getting clipped. Here are a few tips though to help
                                        avoid this:<ul>
                                            <li>Try to avoid copying and pasting your content from other sources as they
                                                can contain their own proprietary styling which will then increase the
                                                amount of code underlying the email which won't be necessary if you're
                                                operating in a Gmail-heavy environment.</li>
                                            <li>Use a single rather than multi-column design, by reducing the number of
                                                columns you also reduce the amount of HTML and styling needed to
                                                structure that particular layout and so reduce the overall weight of the
                                                code.</li>
                                            <li>Rather than trying to target your entire audience in one email, if
                                                possible break it down into multiple emails so that your users are only
                                                seeing what would apply to their segments of the organization</li>

                                                where a 1px line would be inserted at random in the body of some emails

                                            <p>What you see above is an example of what to expect when this issue
                                                occurs, which is that a small part of the your content inherits the
                                                background color for the body of the email which is one method to
                                                workaround this issue using a single color as the background however
                                                using a neutral background color for the sides of the email tends to be
                                                of higher priority and to help readability.</p>

                                            <p>Starting with Outlook 2007, Microsoft implemented Word as the renderer in
                                                Outlook rather than Internet Explorer, however this has led to a number
                                                of issues as Word does not support the full range of CSS styling
                                                available in other desktop and browser-based clients. Due to this,
                                                certain styling elements can vary across Outlook versions based on their
                                                level of support, for example styling a full margin is generally
                                                supported across versions, however if you attempt to style the margin
                                                for just a single side of an item, there will be situations where this
                                                styling is ignored and your content will be flush to the side.</p>
